# NLP Text Processing Project using NLTK

This project is a Google Colab-based notebook that demonstrates basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using Python and the NLTK library. It is designed to showcase tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, POS tagging, and Named Entity Recognition on user-defined text inputs.

## üìÅ Project Contents

- Input text collection
- Sentence and word tokenization
- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging
- Lemmatization and stemming
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- NLTK stopwords usage
- Regular expressions for custom token handling

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Google Colab
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Regular Expressions (`re`)

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Click the link to open the notebook:  
   [Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GCz1h6vimTn_zCxr78ODS57k-dXswN4M?authuser=1)
2. Run the notebook cells in order.
3. Customize the input text as desired for different results.

## üß† Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Text Tokenization**: Breaking text into words and sentences.
- **POS Tagging**: Assigning grammatical labels to words.
- **Lemmatization & Stemming**: Reducing words to their base forms.
- **NER (Named Entity Recognition)**: Identifying entities like names, dates, organizations.
- **Stopwords Filtering**: Removing common words that add little semantic value.

## üì¶ Dependencies

The notebook uses the following packages:

```bash
nltk
re
